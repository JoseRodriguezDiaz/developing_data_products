# Coursera - Developing Data Products - Project  

This project has two parts. First we'll create a Shiny application with
associated supporting documentation We'll also push our project to
Github. The second part includes a reproducible Pitch Presentation,
followed by a peer review.

## MTCAR Dataset  

Our shiny app will use the mtcar data set to explore and predict the nature of the relationship between MPG and other variables.The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and
comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).  

## The Shiny Application

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation.The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github  

## The Reproducible Pitch Presentation

This includes a 5 slide presentation uploaded to this Github Repo
